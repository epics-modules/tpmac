<H2>Backing up PMAC-related information</H2>
</center>

<p>This document is intended for beamline staff. It explains how to
backup various parameters related to PMAC motion controllers.</p>

<p>There are two groups of parameters pertaining the PMAC motion controllers.
The first group is constituted by the parameters like motors speeds,
in-position bands, various servo loop gains, and etc. The second group
consist of calibration parameters like scaling factors and offsets that are
used to recalculate encoders data into engineering units and beamline
elements positions.<p>

<h3>Servo parameters</h3>

<p>The first group of parameters is typically modified with the help of the
PWIN32 (Delta Tau Windows Executable software) or through the following MEDM
form:<p>

<p>Generally it must be saved in the PMAC flash memory which allows to keep
those parameter under a reset or power-up cycle. To save the parameters, press
<B>Save</B> on the above MEDM screen.</p>

<p>In addition, one can create a snapshot (backup) file with all those
parameters saved on the workstation hard drive. This may only be needed as
a precaution in case of potential PMAC factory reset or malfunction. To
save the parameters follow the chart below:</p>

<center><img src="img/PMAC_saving2.jpg" border=2></center>

<p>The snapshot files are saved in /home/gmca/DATA with the names like:</p>

<pre>	MtrBackup-pmac10p2004-Oct-05-1824.pmc</pre>

<p>-- i.e. the PMAC name as well as the date/time stamps are appended. The
software making the backups is the PERL script named:</p>

<pre>	/home/gmca/epics/pezca/mtrBackup.pl</pre>

<p>We have several tools to upload stored snapshots back into PMAC controllers.
Given the complexity of PMAC, restoring should not be done without consulting
with Oleg or Sergey.</p>


<h3>Calibration parameters</h3>

<p>The second group of parameters is typically modified through the calibration
MEDM forms that look like:<p>

<center><img src="img/Calib_adl.jpg" border=2></center>

<p>Generally those parameters are automatically backed up every 30 seconds on
the hard drive of workstation that loads respective VME controller. The files
are stored in the following folder:<p>

<pre>	/home/gmca/epics/synApps/xxxNN/iocBoot/iocgmcaNN/autosave</pre>

<p>where NN stands for the VME controller number. If the VME happens to be
rebooted, the calibration parameters are automatically restored from these
autobackup files. However, there might be situations when those files get
corrupt. Although the probability of such a failure is quite low, as an
additional precaution we have implemented manual backups of calibration
parameters that should be run in case of an essential calibration change.
The manual backups are stored in:</p>

<pre>	/home/gmca/epics/gmcaApp/burt/23x/</pre>

<p>where "x" stands for the beamline name (i,o,b,d).</a>

<p><font color="red"><B>ATTENTION:</B></font> In order to avoid any
confusion, make the backups on the main beamline controls computer only. At
present those computers are:</p>

<center><table border=1>
<tr><td>bl1ws3           </td><td>for ID-in                </td></tr>
<tr><td>bl2dl380upper    </td><td>for ID-out               </td></tr>
<tr><td>px0              </td><td>for the lab environment  </td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>To make a backup, call the following screen:</p>

<center><img src="img/PMAC_saving1.jpg" border=2></center>

<p>Also, make a hardcopy of changed configuration: </p>
<ul>
<li> Right-click on the calibration screen
<li> Select "print"
<li> Attach the printout to the beamline logbook
</ul>
