		     ***** Release 3-11 *****
This release adds the "src_eth" source distribution, which provides
communication with Ethernet-accessed Turbo PMACs (e.g. Turbo PMAC2 UMAC CPU)
with full support for DPRAM and EPICS databases previously developed for
Turbo PMAC2 VME Ultralite. For an example of soft IOC controlling an
Ethernet-accessed PMAC, see the synApps\tpmac_eth_softioc directory.

In addition, it replaces obsolete tsDef.h by epicsTime.h and fixes name
conflict in tsubRecord.c with win32.

Finally, the release include the latest up-to-date changes and bug fixes to
pmacAsynCoordSrc, pmacAsynIPPortSrc, and pmacAsynMotorSrc from the
Diamond Light Source tpmac and pmacCoord distributions. For the details of
changes at the DLS, please consult:

		     ***** Release 3-10 *****
This release contains a number of changes and bug fixes to pmacAsynCoordSrc,
pmacAsynIPPortSrc, pmacAsynMotorSrc produced at Diamond Light Source. Below
is a note from Matthew Pearson <matthew.pearson@diamond.ac.uk>:

!! Changes to pmacAsynIPPort
----------------------------

There are quite a few changes to pmacAsynIPPort.c
* Fix problem with vxWorks builds
* Fix problem reading large buffers composed of multiple packets

!! Changes to pmacAsynMotorSrc
------------------------------

Changes to pmacAsynMotor.h:
* New function prototype to set encoder readback from a different axis number
* New utility function to test reading a large buffer

Changes to pmacAsynMotor.dbd:
* Removed include of motorSupport.dbd, so applications will need to include
  this manually from now.

Changes to pmacAsynMotorRegister.cc
* Added register functions for the two new functions so they can be used on
  the IOC shell.

Changes to pmacAsynMotor.c:
* Made a fix to the deferred move implementation in the PMAC driver. There
  was a race condition between turning off deferred moves and the poller
  thread, which was causing some moves to return early when scanning with
  deferred moves.
* Added amplifier fault bit check. The motor record MSTA problem bit will
  be set if the amplifier fault is on.
* Changed the set position logic to also set the encoder axis position, if
  one is in use. This relies on the correct encoder ratio being set by asyn
  device support.
* Added axis status poll when setting encoder axis number. Changed it to
  use global pAsynUser.
* Added pmacSetOpenLoopEncoderAxis axis configuration routine
* Moved pmac abort (A cmd) earlier in command sequence so drive amps have
  longer to start up
* Changed definition on motorAxisMoving. Now it is set
  desired_velocity_zero=0 & motor activated (ix00=1) & amplifier enabled.
  The new check is for amplifier enabled. This is to prevent EPICS thinking
  an axis is moving if it has been killed.
* Redefined motor done. Now, if we are not in position but the amplifier
  has been disabled then we have finished moving. This will catch fatal
  following errors. In the same database update the fatal following error
  flag should be set. This change is to prevent clients from hanging,
  waiting for a motor to finish moving, in the case of fatal following
  errors.
* Only send a J/ if the amplifier output is enabled. When we send a stop,
  we don't want to power on axes that have been powered off for a reason.
* Better feedback of axis status in the poller thread.

!! Changes to pmacAsynCoordSrc
------------------------------

Changes to pmacAsynCoord.h:
* Added more error bit macros
* Added functions to help with axis scaling.

Changes to pmacAsynCoordRegister.cc:
* Added IOC register functions for the new axis scaling functions.

Changes to pmacAsynCoord.dbd:
* Removed include of motorSupport.dbd, so applications will need to include
  this manually from now.

Changes to pmacAsynCoord.cc:
* Fix a race condition with deferred moves
*  Added in coordinate system axis scaling factor, so we can use real
  coordinates on the controller. It defaults to unity if not used. Added
  IOC shell driver function to set the default coordinate system axis
  scaling factor for all axes.
* Moved pmac abort (A cmd) earlier in command sequence so drive amps have
  longer to start up.
* Abort any existing CS move before trying a new one. This has the welcome
  side effect of putting any motor in this CS into closed loop mode.
* Use a mutex when setting idlePollPeriod and movingPollPeriod in the same
  way as pmacAsynMotor, make the polling a bit more intelligent.
* Improved error reporting.


------------------------------------------------------------
		     ***** Release 3-9 *****
The TSUB (Transformation Subroutine) Record was made portable (independent of
VxWorks) so that now it can be used independently from the TPMAC distribution.

TSUB is a general-purpose EPICS record providing a way to run user-written
transformations in the IOC. The aim of TSUB is to fetch some input values
through TSUB record "input" DB links, to perform a transformation according
to respective transformation subroutine (a user-supplied C-program) and to
push the output values into the "output" DB links. The name of user-supplied
subroutine is specified in the TSUB record SNAM field. TSUB record provides
80 input DB links and 70 output DB links, which should be sufficient for most
needs. By its versatility, it stands between EPICS Sub (subroutine) Record
and aSub (Array Subroutine) records included into EPICS Base, although it was
developed well before aSub. In principle, aSub can be used anywhere instead
of TSUB, provided one converts respective subroutines written for TSUB and
replaces the TSUB DB fields with aSub fields.

A typical use of TSUB records with PMAC is to map from e.g. actual motors
positions into axis positions or from requested axis position into requested
motor position. For example, when one specifies desired monochromator energy,
a TSUB record and the associated subroutine tsubMOEnAxs (see tsubMO.c) are
used to map the value into desired monochromator rotary and monochromator
second crystal translation positions.

The transformation routines in this directory are grouped as one file per
assembly type. So, when one adds a new PMAC motors assembly type (e.g. an
XYZ translation stage), he has to write a new tsubXYZ.c file by analogy
with other assemblies.

As TSUB is a soft record, this release made it independent of VxWorks, so
that now it can be compiled for e.g. Linux IOC and deployed for calculations
not related to TPMAC.

NOTE: the change requires a little tweak of the C-routines written for TSUB:
some includes need to be changed and REGISTRYFUNCTION for the function name
should appended to the end. There are plenty of examples in the tsub
subdirectory.


------------------------------------------------------------
		     ***** Release 3-8 *****
Essentially same as 3-7, but a few examples of coordinate system DBs
added/updated, more documentation, boot tree examples (xxx) added, and the
directory changed from 3-x to synApps/tpmac/3-x reflecting that the package
is a part of synApps.


------------------------------------------------------------
		     ***** Release 3-7 *****
1. Added reporting of PMAC error messages using an EPICS waveform PV.
Before this release PMAC error messages were displayed on IOC console only.
One EPICS waveform PV per PMAC card was added to the db
file .../pmacApp/Db/pmacDb/AsciiPmac_waveform.db:

record(waveform, "$(pmac)StrErr") {
  field(DTYP, "PMAC-VME ASCII")
  field(INP, "#C$(C) S2 @")
  field(FTVL, "CHAR")
  field(NELM, "256")
}

Files drvPmac.c, drvPmac.h, devPmacMbx.c, add_pmac.dbd were modified to add
the waveform record support.

2. File statusRecord.c was modified to include definitions for YES/NO macros
since they are no longer defined in EPICS-3.14.11 include files:

#if !defined(YES) || !defined(NO)
#define YES 1
#define NO 0
#endif

3. A patch by Lewis Muir <jlmuir@anl.gov> to pmacApp/src/devPmacRam.c. Below
is a description per Lewis' email:

"I found that sometimes pmacApp/src/devPmacRam.c:devPmacRamUpdated was
being called with a pointer to a PMAC_RAM_DPVT who's ioscanpvt field was
null.  This resulted in a call to scanIoRequest (line 496) with a null
argument (confirmed with a printf statement) which, I think, resulted in
a null dereference in scanIoRequest.

Looking further, I saw that certain EPICS record initialization
functions in devPmacRam.c called
pmacApp/src/drvPmac.c:drvPmacDpramRequest with devPmacRamUpdated as the
(*pFunc)(void *) argument before calling scanIoInit.
drvPmacDpramRequest sometimes invokes the (*pFunc)(void *) function
which in this case is devPmacRamUpdated.  This means that
devPmacRamUpdated might be called before scanIoInit has been called
which means scanIoRequest might be called with a null argument.

My fix is to move each scanIoInit call *before* each call to
drvPmacDpramRequest so that the PMAC_RAM_DPVT ioscanpvt field will be
initialized before devPmacRamUpdated might be called and hence before
scanIoRequest might be called.

With this fix, my IOC doesn't crash anymore.  However, I'm surprised no
one else has had this problem before.  This makes me less confident
about what I think is going wrong and my fix for it.  I'm no EPICS
internals expert, so I would feel better if one of you looked at the
problem and my proposed fix and agreed with it.  I'm not even sure what
scanIoInit does; I hope it's safe to change the call order (i.e. before
the drvPmacDpramRequest call rather than after it)."

		     ***** Release 3-6 *****

This release contains the following modifications:

- - - - - - - - -
1. New versions of pmacAsynCoordSrc, pmacAsynIPPort and pmacAsynMotorSrc by
Matthew Pearson and Nick Reese from the DIAMOND Light Source:

"I've attached a patch file for pmacAsynIPPort.c (and associated
RELEASE_NOTES).

There's been a lot of changes:

Port to Asyn 4-10 (it compiles with Asyn 4-9, but does not work).
New IOC shell configuration functions.
Reorganization to improve efficiency.

Recently we've also made a lot of changes to the PMAC driver
(pmacAsynMotor.c). I think I should send you a patch file for this too,
with a description of the changes.

Cheers,
Matthew"

2. A patch to AssyGeneric_scanrec.db and bkgfix1pcs_scanrec.db by Lewis
Muir <jlmuir@anl.gov>:

"When performing an sscan module step scan of a tpmac drive, sometimes
the $(assy)Busy record does not get set to Done, and so the sscan record
waits indefinitely for the move to complete.  The move has completed,
but the $(assy)Busy record doesn't reflect this.

I tracked down the problem to the fact that for some moves (maybe small
ones that complete very quickly?), $(pcs)PrgExeSts is never processed
(verified by setting its TPRO field to 1) and hence $(pcs)InPos is never
processed.  This makes Tim Mooney's $(pcs)ClearBusy record not work
right since it never sees $(pcs)InPos transition to 0 (Moving) and then
to 1 (Positioned) - so it never sets $(assy)Busy to Done and so the step
scan waits indefinitely.

Attached is a patch against tpmac 3-5 to fix this problem.  The fix uses
a software-only "in-position" indicator that gets set to 0 (Moving) at
the start of the move and 1 (Positioned) 0.25 sec later.  0.25 sec was
chosen because in the cases where $(pcs)InPos did process, it always
seemed to process within 0.1 sec of having started the move, so 0.25 sec
seemed safe.

The idea is that if $(pcs)InPos has not transitioned to 0 (Moving)
within 0.25 sec of starting the move, it never will.  In this case, the
software-only "in-position" indicator is observed by the $(pcs)ClearBusy
record and it sets $(assy)Busy to Done after 0.25 sec.  If, however,
$(pcs)InPos does transition to 0 (Moving) within 0.25 sec of starting
the move, $(pcs)ClearBusy will track it for determining when the move
completes.

The downside of this patch is that every move will take a minimum of
0.25 sec.  The upside is that step scans will work correctly - the sscan
module will not lock up.

A cleaner fix would be for $(pcs)InPos to transition to 0 (Moving) and
then to 1 (Positioned) for every move (even if the move takes a very
short time).  I didn't look at the C code, but perhaps there's a way to
force $(pcs)PrgExeSts to update right after starting the motion program,
and again once the motion program completes.  Or maybe that won't work,
and a separate flag would be needed that gets set to 0 (Moving) before
starting the motion program and get set to 1 (Positioned) after the
motion program completes (maybe even the motion program itself sets it
as its last instruction)."

3. New, more flexible ccdDb databases (named ccdDb2009).

- - - - - - - - -
4. Small bug fix in motion programs PMC files (thanks to Lewis Muir).

The core part of the distribution (the MAILBOX and DPRAM communication
drivers for PMAC2-VME Ulltralite) did not change with this release.

------------------------------------------------------------
		     ***** Release 3-5 *****

The main motivation for this release is the addition of new IP driver
produced by Pete Leicester and Nick Reese at the DIAMOND Light Source. This
driver should allow communicating with Ethernet based Delta Tau controllers.
Below is the message from Nick:

----
For some time I have been meaning to forward the following to you. It
contains an asyn interpose driver for an asynIPPort interface for the
Delta Tau PMAC controllers. It should be placed in the pmacApp directory
and, if properly configured, should allow you to control a number of the
Ethernet based Delta Tau controllers.

The other thing we are working on is a asynMotor record interface to the
various axes of a PMAC co-ordinate system. This will enable you to, for
example, control a monochrometer in pure energy units through an EPICS
motor record. This works, but we are trying to work out the finer points
of save/restore etc before releasing it.

[...] it should be clear that the new IP driver (and all the asyn Drivers)
are only useful for your PMAC ASCII interface and cannot provide a PMAC
DPRAM interface over the network. This is so obvious it should go without
saying, but I'll say it anyway. However, I really want to keep the code
base together, and your site is the logical distribution point.

The core part of the distribution (the MAILBOX and DPRAM communication
drivers for PMAC2-VME Ulltralite) did not change with this release.
However, now the driver has been tested to operate with both Tornado-2.0
and Tornado-2.2.

The databases and tsub routines underwent minor changes and bug fixes.

Some convenient GUI tools have been added to the Tcl/Tk part including
"Motors List", "Assemblies List" and a new frontend to homing. Homing
itself is implemented as a bunch of Perl/Pezca scripts that are not
included into this distro, but may be available on request along with
the fast scanning software that is also based on PMAC drivers.

------------------------------------------------------------
		     ***** Release 3-4 *****

Compared to 3-3, release 3-4 is basically a bug fix. The only updated
part is pmacApp/src where a long-standing bug from the initial 1996
implementation has been finally nailed down and fixed. The bug related
to improper mutexing was causing pmacMbox task to crash occasionally,
especially under high IOC load.

-- Oleg Makarov


------------------------------------------------------------
		     ***** Release 3-3 *****

New features introduced in the 3-3 release:

1) added get_enum_str() function to the statusRecord.c.
this allows to query BI00-BI31 fields of the status record for debugging.
examples:

ioc1>dbgf "23d:CCD:ml:SvoSts.BI16"
DBR_STRING:          ON
value = 0 = 0x0
ioc1>

gmca@px0:/home/gmca 1 > caget 23d:CCD:ml:SvoSts.BI16
23d:CCD:ml:SvoSts.BI16         ON
gmca@px0:/home/gmca 2 >



2) improved DPRAM-ASCII part of the PMAC driver by removing
unnecessary queue from drvPmacMbxTask() in the drvPmac.c.
Epics record get processed by the drvPmacMbxTask(), this eliminated
errors with intermixing PMAC responses under higher IOC load.


3) improved efficiency of pmacAscReadMeISR() in the pmacDriver.c
- replaced two VME bus reads of byte size by one of uint16 size,
- removed useless line at the end of pmacAscReadMeISR:
  control = getReg( *dpramAsciiInControl );

4) added support for ACC-59E in the file devPmacMbx.c. Currently the supoort
corresponds to the bipolar configuration of DAC only.
